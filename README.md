# SunTide  :sunny: :ocean:  
<sup> v3.1.0 </sup>  
  
A script to generate .csv files with data containing day-by-day tide predictions and daylight information for a given year.  
  
  
## Using the Program
To use the program, simply run main.py with a Python interperator. A terminal will open, and the user will asked if they want data for the current year, or next year. Type either 'this' or 'next' and press ENTER. The program will then compile the spreadsheets.  
> [!TIP]
> Be aware that there are a couple other settings, defined as constants in main.py. Different locations can be selected as the source of the data by changing these:
> - Sun Location - The location to use to generate sunrise and sunset times in latitude/longitude coordinates
> - Tide Locations - A list of NOAA station ID's. These are seven digit ID numbers that correspond to locations around the US that have a station that records and predicts tide data.  
  
  
## The Output  
> [!WARNING]
> There is no guarantee that the information generated by this program will be accurate.
   
### The Suntimes CSV
Contains information such as sunrise and sunset times for every day in the year.
One row per day. The column headers are as follows:  
  
*DAY, MONTH, DATE, SUNRISE, SUNSET, DUR, DIFF, MORE/LESS*  
- Day - The abbreviated name of the weekday  
- Month - The name of the month  
- Date - The day of the month  
- Sunrise - The time of sunrise (HH:MM)  
- Sunset - The time of sunset (HH:MM)  
- Dur - The amount of daylight (hrs:mins)  
- Diff - The change in daylight from yesterday (hrs:mins:secs)
- More/Less - If the change was positive or negative  
> [!NOTE]
> Daylight related times are calculated using the U.S. Naval Observeratory's algorithm.
  
### The Tides CSV
Contains information such as tide height for every day in the year.
One row per tide (so a day can have multiple rows). The column headers are as follows:  
  
*DATE, DAY, TYPE, HEIGHT, TIME*  
- Date - The date (mm-dd)  
- Day - The abbreviated name of the weekday  
- Type - If the tide is low or high  
- Height - The height of the tide in feet  
- Time - The time of the tide (HH:MM)  

If the program is told to get tides for multiple locations, the headers will be arranged horizonally, and a number added as a suffix to each column. For example, if two locations are specified, the headers will be:  
DATE1, DAY1, TYPE1, HEIGHT1, TIME1, DATE2, DAY2, TYPE2, HEIGHT2, TIME2  
Headers with suffix 1 in this example would corrospond to the first location given, and headers with suffix 2 to the second location.

> Tide predictions are generated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and retrieved from thier [API](https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/)
